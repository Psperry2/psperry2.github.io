# psperry2.github.io
My name is Precious Perry and my email address is psperry2@my.waketech.edu.
This is my first time creating a github account so there is not much on there other than a few practice projects from the videos on linkedin.
In this repository I am introducing my name and email address and describing my github account.
To clone my repositiory onto my local machine, I copied the link in GitHub and opened up my terminal. My first step was to make sure I was in the correct folder, which I used the cd command to assist me. To clone the repositiory, I used git clone (paste URL) and hit enter.

# About Me:
## My Interests.
* I enjoy going for long walks in nature. I usually go on about 2-3 walks a weeks with my 3 year old pomchi. 
* I also enjoy trying foods from different cultures. My favorite dishes currently are dora wat (Ethiopian), paneer (Indian) and jollaf rice (Ghanaian). 
* Lastly, I have been taking yoga classes for about half a year and it's became something I enjoy while also improving my flexibility.
## Websites I Recommend.
* The first website I recommend is [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com). I watch videos on youtube atleast 5 days a week (excessive, right?). I enjoy watching vlogs, podcasts and I also use it for educational purposes if I need something explained. 
* I also recommend [x](https://x.com), formally known as twitter. This website knows how to make me laugh until my stomach hurts. If something important happened, this is usually the website I can go to and learn more about the situation and also see others debating on said topic.
