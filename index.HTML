    <h1>My name is Precious Perry</h1>
    <p>I graduated with my bachelors in Biology from NC State in spring of 2023. 
    I have hopes getting my masters degree soon, but I dont know what route I would like to go yet. 
    Hopefully I can find a program that includes biology and programming.</p>
