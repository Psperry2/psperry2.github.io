# psperry2.github.io
My name is Precious Perry and my email address is psperry2@my.waketech.edu
This is my first time creating a github account so there is not much on there other than a few practice projects from the videos on linkedin.
In this repository I am introducing my name and email address and describing my github account.
To clone my repositiory onto my local machine, I copied the link in GitHub and opened up my terminal. My first step was to make sure I was in the correct folder, which I used the cd command to assist me. To clone the repositiory, I used git clone (paste URL) and hit enter.
